Emotion Detection Web Application
This repository contains code for a web application that performs emotion detection using both text and image inputs. The application is built using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications.

Features
Text Emotion Detection
Users can input text into a text area.
The application predicts the emotion conveyed by the text.
Emotions predicted include anger, disgust, fear, joy, neutral, sadness, and surprise.
Predictions are displayed along with confidence scores.
Image Emotion Recognition
Users can upload an image file (JPEG or PNG format).
The application detects faces in the image and predicts the emotion expressed by each face.
Emotions predicted include anger, disgust, fear, joy, neutral, sadness, and surprise.
Predictions are displayed alongside the uploaded image.
